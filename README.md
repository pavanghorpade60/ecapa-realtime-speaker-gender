# 🎤 Real-Time Speaker & Gender Identification using ECAPA-TDNN

## 🚀 About This Project

This project is a real-time speaker and gender identification system built using the ECAPA-TDNN deep learning architecture.  

It captures live audio from a microphone, processes it in real time, and predicts:
- Who is speaking (Speaker Identification)
- The speaker’s gender (Gender Classification)

The entire system is built using PyTorch and designed to be modular, efficient, and easy to extend.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I wanted to explore practical audio AI systems beyond theory.  
Instead of just training a model, I implemented a complete real-time pipeline that:

- Takes live microphone input
- Processes audio features
- Generates speaker embeddings
- Performs classification instantly

This project helped me understand:
- Audio preprocessing
- Deep learning for speech tasks
- Real-time inference systems
- Model deployment workflows

    D --> E[Speaker Embedding]
    E --> F[Speaker Classifier]
    E --> G[Gender Classifier]
    F --> H[Predicted Speaker]
    G --> I[Predicted Gender]
```

### 🔎 Step-by-Step Pipeline

1. The microphone captures live audio.
2. The audio is cleaned and normalized.
3. Mel Spectrogram features are extracted.
4. The ECAPA-TDNN model generates a speaker embedding.
5. The embedding is passed to:
   - A speaker classification head
   - A gender classification head
6. Predictions are displayed in real time.
